1. Use `predict_energy_holdout_unrelaxed.py` to predict energy of holdout unrelaxed structures (as mentioned in manuscript).
2. Use `analyze_holdout_unrelaxed.py` to compute (Metric)<sub>1</sub> and (Metric)<sub>2</sub> as mentioned in manuscript.

Note: make necessary changes in the code to point to the correct path of the model and data.
