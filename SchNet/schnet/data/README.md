1. The file `matbench_demo.py` can be used to fetch Matbench formation energy dataset.
2. The file `augment_from_file_uniform.py` can be used to augment the dataset with controlled perturbation without affecting the energy labels.
3. The file `augment_from_file_modelmapped_uniform.py` can be used to augment the dataset with controlled perturbation while using an existing model to generate energy labels.
